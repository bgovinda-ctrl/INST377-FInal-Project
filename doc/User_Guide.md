# Global Earthquake Alert System  
## User Manual


## 1. Introduction

The **Global Earthquake Alert System** is a web-based application designed to help users stay informed about recent earthquakes around the world. The system provides real-time earthquake data, visualizes seismic activity on an interactive map, and allows users to subscribe to alerts based on location and earthquake magnitude.

This user manual explains how to access, navigate, and use the system’s features without requiring any technical or programming background.



## 2. Intended Users

This application is intended for:
- General public users interested in earthquake activity
- Residents of earthquake-prone regions
- Students and researchers seeking real-time seismic data
- Emergency preparedness planners and organizations

No account creation or technical expertise is required to use the system.



## 3. Supported Platforms and Browsers

The Global Earthquake Alert System is a web application and can be accessed using modern browsers on the following platforms:

### Browsers
- Google Chrome 
- Microsoft Edge




## 4. Accessing the Application

1. Open a supported web browser
2. Navigate to the deployed application URL (provided by the project administrator)
3. The home page will load automatically with recent earthquake information

No login or registration is required to view earthquake data.



## 5. Application Features Overview

The Global Earthquake Alert System provides the following key features:

- Real-time earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake API
- Interactive map showing earthquake locations
- Earthquake list with magnitude, location, and time
- Subscription form for earthquake alerts
- Filtering based on location and magnitude thresholds



## 6. Viewing Recent Earthquakes

### Earthquake List
Upon loading the application, users will see a list of recent earthquakes that includes:
- Location (region or nearest city)
- Earthquake magnitude
- Date and time of occurrence

Earthquakes are updated automatically based on the latest data available from the USGS.



## 7. Interactive Map

The interactive map allows users to visually explore earthquake activity.

### Map Features:
- Each earthquake is represented by a marker
- Marker size reflects earthquake magnitude
- Clicking a marker displays:
  - Location
  - Magnitude
  - Time of occurrence

Users can zoom in and out of the map and pan across different regions of the world.



## 8. Subscribing to Earthquake Alerts

The alert subscription feature allows users to receive notifications when earthquakes meet certain criteria.

### How to Subscribe:
1. Navigate to the **Alert Subscription** section
2. Enter your email address
3. Enter a location (e.g., California, Japan)
4. Select a minimum earthquake magnitude
5. Submit the form

Once submitted, the system stores your alert preferences.




## 9. Understanding Alert Criteria

Alerts are triggered when:
- An earthquake occurs in the specified location
- The earthquake magnitude is equal to or greater than the selected threshold

This helps users avoid unnecessary notifications while focusing on relevant seismic events.



## 10. Data Source and Accuracy

Earthquake data is provided by:
- **United States Geological Survey (USGS)**

The data is:
- Publicly available
- Updated frequently
- Considered reliable for general awareness



## 11. Known Limitations

Users should be aware of the following limitations:

- No user authentication or login
- Alert notifications may be mocked or limited
- Location filtering is text-based and not geospatially precise
- Internet connection is required
- Data depends on availability of the USGS API



## 12. Best Practices for Users

- Use official emergency services for critical safety decisions
- Verify alerts with local authorities
- Do not rely solely on this system for evacuation or emergency response
- Regularly check the map for updated information



## 13. Troubleshooting

### Map Does Not Load
- Refresh the page
- Ensure internet connectivity
- Try a different browser

### No Earthquake Data Displayed
- The data source may be temporarily unavailable
- Reload the application after a few minutes

### Subscription Form Not Working
- Ensure all fields are filled correctly
- Use a valid email format




## 14. Conclusion

The Global Earthquake Alert System provides an easy-to-use interface for monitoring global earthquake activity and receiving customized alerts. While it is intended for informational and educational purposes, it helps users stay aware of seismic events and encourages preparedness.
